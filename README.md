A novel 3D simulation for closed ecological systems usingsimplified evolution
This article introduces a gene evolution approach by extending the predator-prey model. The main goal is to show that in a simulational ecosystem environment the natural selection process can aid the animals to adapt, thus help slightly stabilize unbalanced parameters of a simulation. These unbalanced parameters are the animals' attributes, and by changing from predetermined parameters, animals can inherit and mutate generational traits (genes), resulting in unique individuals in the system. This means some individuals have traits better suited to the current environment and the current situation than others. During the simulation the less suitable animals are more likely will decease, while the more fit individuals have better chances of surviving. Natural selection occurs as a result of this consequence, and the creatures who survive the longest have more opportunities to reproduce. When fitter animals reproduce, their offspring are more likely to receive similarly good gene values to the prior fit scenario, although their qualities are altered during the reproduction's mutation process. When the situation changes and other qualities' values become more significant in the next generation, descendants whose gene values have mutated in the proper direction dictated by the new scenario will be identified as the new fitter animals, and the natural selection cycle will restart.

Animal Farm - a Complex Artificial Life 3D Framework

The development of a computer-generated ecosystem simulations is becoming more common due to the greater computational capabilities of machines. Because natural ecosystems are very complex, simplifications are required for implementation. This simulation environment offer a global view of the system and generate a lot of data to process and analyse, which are difficult or impossible to do in nature. 3D simulations, besides of the scientific advantages in experiments, can be used for presentation, educational and entertainment purposes too. In our simulated framework (Animal Farm) we have implemented a few basic animal behaviors and mechanics to observe in 3D. All animals are controlled by an individual logic model which determines the animals next action based on their needs and surrounding environment.
