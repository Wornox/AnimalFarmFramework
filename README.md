Animal Farm Evo - a closed ecological system for simplified evolution showcases

This article introduces a gene evolution approach in an extended predator-prey model. In our 3D simulated framework (Animal Farm) we have developed a few fundamental animal behaviors and mechanics to create and manage closed ecosystem environments, while gathering data. Aside from the scientific advantages in research, computer-simulations can also be utilized for presentation, teaching, and entertainment. With the new evolution approach, we suggests the possibility that in a simulational ecosystem environment the natural selection process can aid the animals to adapt, by slightly stabilizing preset parameters of the animals in the simulation. During the simulation the less suitable animals are more likely will decease, while the more fit individuals have better chances of surviving and inheriting their gene structure. The descendants, whose gene values had mutated in the proper direction indicated by the new scenario will be identified as the new fitter animals, and the natural selection cycle will restart. In the paper, we introduce the topic of ecosystem simulations and connected biological works. We also describe why and how we enhanced the predator-prey model with evolutional approaches and show a possible implementation of the system. We present a demonstrational run and analyze possible effects on the animals using the developed system. Also, we discuss potential areas of use, such as animated ecological showcases for students, and propose improvements to our and suggestions to other future evolutional models.

Animal Farm - a Complex Artificial Life 3D Framework

http://www.acta.sapientia.ro/acta-info/C13-1/info13-1-4.pdf

The development of a computer-generated ecosystem simulations is becoming more common due to the greater computational capabilities of machines. Because natural ecosystems are very complex, simplifications are required for implementation. This simulation environment offer a global view of the system and generate a lot of data to process and analyse, which are difficult or impossible to do in nature. 3D simulations, besides of the scientific advantages in experiments, can be used for presentation, educational and entertainment purposes too. In our simulated framework (Animal Farm) we have implemented a few basic animal behaviors and mechanics to observe in 3D. All animals are controlled by an individual logic model which determines the animals next action based on their needs and surrounding environment.
