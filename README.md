Animal Farm - a Complex Artificial Life 3D Framework

The development of a computer-generated ecosystem simulations is becoming more common due to the greater computational capabilities of machines. Because natural ecosystems are very complex, simplifications are required for implementation. This simulation environment offer a global view of the system and generate a lot of data to process and analyse, which are difficult or impossible to do in nature. 3D simulations, besides of the scientific advantages in experiments, can be used for presentation, educational and entertainment purposes too. In our simulated framework (Animal Farm) we have implemented a few basic animal behaviors and mechanics to observe in 3D. All animals are controlled by an individual logic model which determines the animals next action based on their needs and surrounding environment.
