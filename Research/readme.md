## Research - 3, GeneEvolution

Created for the "A novel 3D simulation for closed ecological systems usingsimplified evolution" article publication.

Here we published 2 sample run gathered datas from the framework with four sample species (illustrative,fantasy named: Lion, Dog, Chicken, Grain(Vegetation) ).

In the Datasets folder, there are the raw csv datasets, and hand made summarys for statistic calcalations.

In the Diagrams folder, there are a few statistics diagrams both in .png and .svg picture formats, created by the summary datasets and used in the articles.

## Research - 2, PackAbility

Created for the "Animal Farm - a Complex Artificial Life 3D Framework" article publication.

Here we published multiple runs with different settings. The gathered datas from the framework with 6 sample species (illustrative,fantasy named: Lion, Dog, Chicken, Cow, Fox, Grain(Vegetation) ).

Alongside with the runs, we uploaded our hypotesis results from the statistics.
