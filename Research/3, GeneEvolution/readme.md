## Research - 3, GeneEvolution

Created for the "Using the Unity game engine to develop 3D simulated ecological system based on a predator-prey model extended by gene evolution" article publication.

Here we published 2 simulational runs' gathered datas from the framework. One simplified verison, and one extended version which was used in the mentioned article as a demonstartional experiment which contains four sample species (illustrative,fantasy named: Lion, Dog, Chicken, Grain(Vegetation) ).
Also a standard non-evolutional simualtion for the comparison in the article to the extended version.

In the Datasets folder, there are the raw csv datasets, and hand made summarys for statistic calcalations.

In the Diagrams folder, there are a few statistics diagrams both in .png and .svg picture formats, created by the summary datasets and used in the articles.
